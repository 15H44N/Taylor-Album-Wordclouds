Speak Now,Mean,Got me feeling like I'm nothing,2010
Speak Now,Mean,"You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard",2010
Speak Now,Mean,Calling me out when I'm wounded,2010
Speak Now,Mean,"You, picking on the weaker man",2010
Speak Now,Mean,But you can take me down with just one single blow,2010
Speak Now,Mean,But you don't know what you don't know,2010
Speak Now,Mean,"Someday, I'll be living in a big old city",2010
Speak Now,Mean,And all you're ever gonna be is mean,2010
Speak Now,Mean,"Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me",2010
Speak Now,Mean,And all you're ever gonna be is mean,2010
Speak Now,Mean,Why you gotta be so mean?,2010
Speak Now,Mean,"You, with your switching sides",2010
Speak Now,Mean,And your wildfire lies and your humiliation,2010
Speak Now,Mean,You have pointed out my flaws again,2010
Speak Now,Mean,As if I don't already see them,2010
Speak Now,Mean,"I walk with my head down, trying to block you out",2010
Speak Now,Mean,'Cause I'll never impress you,2010
Speak Now,Mean,I just want to feel okay again,2010
Speak Now,Mean,I bet you got pushed around,2010
Speak Now,Mean,Somebody made you cold,2010
Speak Now,Mean,But the cycle ends right now,2010
Speak Now,Mean,'Cause you can't lead me down that road,2010
Speak Now,Mean,And you don't know what you don't know,2010

Speak Now,Mean,And all you're ever gonna be is mean,2010
Speak Now,Mean,"Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me",2010
Speak Now,Mean,And all you're ever gonna be is mean,2010
Speak Now,Mean,Why you gotta be so mean?,2010
Speak Now,Mean,And I can see you years from now in a bar,2010
Speak Now,Mean,Talking over a football game,2010
Speak Now,Mean,With that same big loud opinion,2010
Speak Now,Mean,But nobody's listening,2010
Speak Now,Mean,Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things,2010
Speak Now,Mean,Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing,2010
Speak Now,Mean,But all you are is mean,2010
Speak Now,Mean,All you are is mean,2010
Speak Now,Mean,"And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life",2010
Speak Now,Mean,"And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean",2010
Speak Now,Mean,But someday I'll be living in a big old city,2010
Speak Now,Mean,"And all you're ever going to be is mean, yeah!",2010
Speak Now,Mean,"Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me",2010

Speak Now,Mean,(Why you gotta be so mean?),2010
Speak Now,Mean,"Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me",2010
Speak Now,Mean,(Why you gotta be so mean?),2010
Speak Now,Mean,And all you're ever gonna be is mean,2010
Speak Now,Mean,Why you gotta be so mean?,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,How we met,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,And the sparks flew instantly,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,And people would say they're the lucky ones,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,I used to know my place was a spot next to you,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,"Oh, a simple complication",2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,Miscommunications lead to fallout,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,So many things that I wish you knew,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,So many walls up that I can't break through,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,And we're not speaking,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,And I'm dying to know,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,Is it killing you like it's killing me?,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,"Yeah, I don't know what to say since a twist of fate, when it all broke down",2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,Next chapter,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,How'd we end up this way?,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,And you're doing your best to avoid me,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,Of how I was losing my mind when I saw you here,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,But you held your pride like you should have held me,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,"Oh, I'm scared to see the ending",2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,Why are we pretending this is nothing?,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,"I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how",2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,I've never heard silence quite this loud,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,And we're not speaking,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,And I'm dying to know,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,Is it killing you like it's killing me?,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,"Yeah, and I don't know what to say since a twist of fate, when it all broke down",2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,This is looking like a contest,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,Of who can act like they care less,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,But I liked it better when you were on my side,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,The battle's in your hands now,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,But I would lay my armor down,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,If you say you'd rather love than fight,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,So many things that you wish I knew,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,But the story of us might be ending soon,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,And we're not speaking,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,And I'm dying to know,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,Is it killing you like it's killing me?,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,"Yeah, and I don't know what to say since a twist of fate, when it all broke down",2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,"And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now",2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,And we're not speaking,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me?,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,Yeah,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,"And I don't know what to say since a twist of fate, because we're going down",2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now,2010
Speak Now,The Story of Us,The End,2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,Your little hand's wrapped around my finger,2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,And it's so quiet in the world tonight,2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming,2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,"So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light",2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,"To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret",2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,"I'd give all I have, honey",2010

Speak Now,Never Grow Up,And no one will desert you,2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,"Just try to never grow up, never grow up",2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,You're in the car on the way to the movies,2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off,2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,At 14 there's just so much you can't do,2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots,2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,But don't make her drop you off around the block,2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,Remember that she's getting older too,2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school,2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,"Oh darling, don't you ever grow up",2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,"Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little",2010

Speak Now,Never Grow Up,"No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred",2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,"And even though you want to, just try to never grow up",2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room,2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home,2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,"Remember the footsteps, remember the words said",2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,And all your little brother's favorite songs,2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone,2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,So here I am in my new apartment,2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,"In a big city, they just dropped me off",2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,It's so much colder that I thought it would be,2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on,2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,Wish I'd never grown up,2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,I wish I'd never grown up,2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,"Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up",2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,I could still be little,2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,"Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up",2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,It could still be simple,2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,"Oh darling, don't you ever grow up",2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,"Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little",2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,"Oh darling, don't you ever grow up",2010

Speak Now,Never Grow Up,"Oh, don't you ever grow up",2010
Speak Now,Never Grow Up,"Oh, never grow up, just never grow up",2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,There I was again tonight,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,"Forcing laughter, faking smiles",2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,"Same old tired, lonely place",2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,"Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy",2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,Vanished when I saw your face,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,All I can say is,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,It was enchanting to meet you,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,"Your eyes whispered ""have we met?""",2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,Across the room your silhouette,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,Starts to make its way to me,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,The playful conversation starts,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,Counter all your quick remarks,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,Like passing notes in secrecy,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,And it was,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,Enchanting to meet you,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,All I can say is,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,I was enchanted to meet you,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,This night is sparkling,2010

Speak Now,Enchanted,I'll spend forever,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,Wondering if you knew,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,I was enchanted to meet you,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,The lingering question kept me up,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,"2AM, who do you love?",2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,I wonder 'til I'm wide awake,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,And now I'm pacing back and forth,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,Wishing you were at my door,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,"I'd open up and you would say ""hey""",2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,It was,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,Enchanting to meet you,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,All I know is I was,2010

Speak Now,Enchanted,Don't you let it go,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,I'm wonderstruck,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,Dancing around all alone,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,I'll spend forever,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,Wondering if you knew,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,I was enchanted to meet you,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,This is me praying that,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,This was the very first page,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,Not where the storyline ends,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,My thoughts will echo your name,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,Until I see you again,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,These are the words I held back,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,As I was leaving too soon,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,I was enchanted to meet you,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,Please don't be in love,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,With someone else,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,Please don't have somebody,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,Waiting on you,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,Please don't be in love,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,With someone else,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,Please don't have somebody,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,Waiting on you,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,This night is sparkling,2010

Speak Now,Enchanted,Wondering if you knew,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,I was enchanted to meet you,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,Please don't be in love,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,With someone else,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,Please don't have somebody,2010
Speak Now,Enchanted,Waiting on you,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,"Ha, time for a little revenge",2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,"I had it all, I had him right there, where I wanted him",2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,"She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause",2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,She took him faster than you can say sabotage,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,"I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it",2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,I underestimated just who I was dealing with,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,She underestimated just who she was stealing from,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,She's not a saint and she's not what you think,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,"She's an actress, whoa",2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,She's better known for the things that she does,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,"On the mattress, whoa",2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,On the playground won't make you many friends,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,"She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind",2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,"There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha!",2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,"Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me",2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,She's not a saint and she's not what you think,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,"She's an actress, whoa",2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,She's better known for the things that she does,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,"On the mattress, whoa",2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,On the playground won't make you many friends,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,"She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind",2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,"There is nothing I do better than revenge, HA!",2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,"I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey",2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,"You might have him, but haven't you heard?",2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,"I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey",2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,"You might have him, but I always get the last word",2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,"Whoa, whoa-ah-oh",2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,She's not a saint and she's not what you think,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,"She's an actress, whoa",2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,She's better known for the things that she does,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,"On the mattress, whoa",2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,On the playground won't make you many friends,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,"She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind",2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,"There is nothing I do better than revenge, HA!",2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,"'Cause I don't think you do, oh",2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,"I don't think you do, I don't think you do",2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,Let's hear the applause,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,"Come on, show me how much better you are (so much better, yeah?)",2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,See you deserve some applause,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,'Cause you're so much better,2010
Speak Now,Better Than Revenge,She took him faster than you could say sabotage,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,I guess you really did it this time,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,Left yourself in your warpath,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,Lost your balance on a tightrope,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,Lost your mind trying to get it back,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,Always a bigger bed to crawl into,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,And everybody believed in you?,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,"It's alright, just wait and see",2010
Speak Now,Innocent,Your string of lights is still bright to me,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,"Oh, who you are is not where you've been",2010
Speak Now,Innocent,You're still an innocent,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,You're still an innocent,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,Did some things you can't speak of,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,But at night you live it all again,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,If only you had seen what you know now then,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,"When everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you",2010
Speak Now,Innocent,Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,Before the monsters caught up to you?,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,"It's alright, just wait and see",2010
Speak Now,Innocent,Your string of lights is still bright to me,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,Ohwho you are is not where you've been,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,You're still an innocent,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,"It's okay, life is a tough crowd",2010
Speak Now,Innocent,"32, and still growing up now",2010
Speak Now,Innocent,Who you are is not what you did,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,You're still an innocent,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,Time turns flames to embers,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,You'll have new Septembers,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,Every one of us has messed up too,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,Lives change like the weather,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,I hope you remember,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,Today is never too late to be brand new,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,"It's alright, just wait and see",2010
Speak Now,Innocent,Your string of lights is still bright to me,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,"Oh, who you are is not where you've been",2010

Speak Now,Innocent,You're still an innocent,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,You're still an innocent,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,Lost your balance on a tightrope,2010
Speak Now,Innocent,It's never too late to get it back,2010
Speak Now,Haunted,You and I walk a fragile line,2010
Speak Now,Haunted,I have known it all this time,2010
Speak Now,Haunted,But I never thought I'd live to see it break,2010
Speak Now,Haunted,It's getting dark and it's all too quiet,2010
Speak Now,Haunted,And I can't trust anything now,2010
Speak Now,Haunted,And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake,2010
Speak Now,Haunted,"Whoa, holding my breath",2010
Speak Now,Haunted,Won't lose you again,2010
Speak Now,Haunted,Something's made your eyes go cold,2010
Speak Now,Haunted,"C'mon, c'mon, don't leave me like this",2010
Speak Now,Haunted,I thought I had you figured out,2010
Speak Now,Haunted,Something's gone terribly wrong,2010
Speak Now,Haunted,You're all I wanted,2010
Speak Now,Haunted,"C'mon, c'mon, don't leave me like this",2010
Speak Now,Haunted,I thought I had you figured out,2010
Speak Now,Haunted,Can't breathe whenever you're gone,2010
Speak Now,Haunted,Can't turn back now I'm haunted,2010
Speak Now,Haunted,Stood there and watched you walk away,2010
Speak Now,Haunted,From everything we had,2010
Speak Now,Haunted,But I still mean every word I said to you,2010
Speak Now,Haunted,He will try to take away my pain,2010
Speak Now,Haunted,And he just might make me smile,2010
Speak Now,Haunted,But the whole time I'm wishing it was you instead,2010
Speak Now,Haunted,"Oh, holding my breath",2010
Speak Now,Haunted,Won't see you again,2010
Speak Now,Haunted,Something keeps me holding onto nothing,2010
Speak Now,Haunted,"C'mon, c'mon, don't leave me like this",2010

Speak Now,Long Live,We were the Kings and the Queens,2010
Speak Now,Long Live,And they read off our names,2010
Speak Now,Long Live,The night you danced like you knew our lives,2010

Speak Now,Long Live,And bring on all the pretenders,2010
Speak Now,Long Live,"One day, we will be remembered",2010
Speak Now,Long Live,I said remember this feeling,2010
Speak Now,Long Live,I passed the pictures around,2010
Speak Now,Long Live,Of all the years that we stood there,2010
Speak Now,Long Live,On the side-lines wishing for right now,2010
Speak Now,Long Live,We are the Kings and the Queens,2010
Speak Now,Long Live,You traded your baseball cap for a crown,2010
Speak Now,Long Live,When they gave us our trophies,2010
Speak Now,Long Live,And we held them up for our town,2010
Speak Now,Long Live,And the cynics were outraged,2010
Speak Now,Long Live,"Screaming ""this is absurd""",2010
Speak Now,Long Live,Cause for a moment a band of thieves,2010
Speak Now,Long Live,In ripped up jeans got to rule the world,2010
Speak Now,Long Live,Long live the walls we crashed through,2010
Speak Now,Long Live,All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you,2010

Speak Now,Long Live,I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you,2010
Speak Now,Long Live,I was screaming long live that look on your face,2010
Speak Now,Long Live,And bring on all the pretenders,2010
Speak Now,Long Live,"One day, we will be remembered",2010

Speak Now,Long Live,Will you take a moment?,2010
Speak Now,Long Live,Promise me this,2010
Speak Now,Long Live,That you'll stand by me forever,2010
Speak Now,Long Live,But if God forbid fate should step in,2010
Speak Now,Long Live,And force us into a goodbye,2010
Speak Now,Long Live,If you have children some day,2010
Speak Now,Long Live,When they point to the pictures,2010
Speak Now,Long Live,Please tell them my name,2010
Speak Now,Long Live,Tell them how the crowds went wild,2010
Speak Now,Long Live,Tell them how I hope they shine,2010
Speak Now,Long Live,Long live the walls we crashed through,2010
Speak Now,Long Live,"I had the time of my life, with you",2010
Speak Now,Long Live,"Long, long live the walls we crashed through",2010

Red,Treacherous,Put your lips close to mine,2012
Red,Treacherous,As long as they don't touch,2012
Red,Treacherous,"Out of focus, eye to eye",2012
Red,Treacherous,Till the gravity's too much,2012
Red,Treacherous,And I'll do anything you say,2012
Red,Treacherous,If you say it with your hands,2012
Red,Treacherous,And I'd be smart to walk away,2012
Red,Treacherous,But you're quick sand,2012

Red,Treacherous,Getting swept away,2012
Red,Treacherous,I hear the sound of my own voice,2012
Red,Treacherous,Asking you to stay,2012
Red,Treacherous,And all we are is skin and bone trained to get along,2012
Red,Treacherous,Forever going with the flow but you're friction,2012
Red,Treacherous,This slope is treacherous,2012
Red,Treacherous,This path is reckless,2012
Red,Treacherous,This slope is treacherous,2012
Red,Treacherous,And I I I like it,2012
Red,Treacherous,Two headlights shine through the sleepless night,2012
Red,Treacherous,And I will get you get you alone,2012

Red,All Too Well,"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold",2012
Red,All Too Well,But something 'bout it felt like home somehow and I,2012
Red,All Too Well,Left my scarf there at your sister's house,2012
Red,All Too Well,"And you've still got it in your drawer, even now",2012
Red,All Too Well,"Oh, your sweet disposition",2012
Red,All Too Well,And my wide-eyed gaze,2012
Red,All Too Well,We're singing in a car getting lost Upstate,2012
Red,All Too Well,The autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place,2012
Red,All Too Well,And I can picture it after all these days,2012
Red,All Too Well,"And I know it's long gone, and that magic's not here no more",2012
Red,All Too Well,"And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all",2012
Red,All Too Well,'Cause there we are again on that little town street,2012
Red,All Too Well,You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me,2012
Red,All Too Well,"Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well",2012
Red,All Too Well,Photo album on the counter,2012
Red,All Too Well,Your cheeks were turning red,2012
Red,All Too Well,You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed,2012
Red,All Too Well,And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team,2012
Red,All Too Well,You taught me about your past thinking your future was me,2012
Red,All Too Well,"And I know it's long gone, and there was nothing else I could do",2012
Red,All Too Well,And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to,2012
Red,All Too Well,'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night,2012
Red,All Too Well,We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light,2012
Red,All Too Well,"Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah",2012
Red,All Too Well,And maybe we got lost in translation,2012
Red,All Too Well,Maybe I asked for too much,2012
Red,All Too Well,But maybe this thing was a masterpiece,2012
Red,All Too Well,'Till you tore it all up,2012
Red,All Too Well,"Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well",2012
Red,All Too Well,And you call me up again just to break me like a promise,2012
Red,All Too Well,So casually cruel in the name of being honest,2012
Red,All Too Well,I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here,2012
Red,All Too Well,"'Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well",2012
Red,All Too Well,Time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it,2012
Red,All Too Well,I'd like to be my old self again,2012
Red,All Too Well,But I'm still trying to find it,2012
Red,All Too Well,After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own,2012
Red,All Too Well,Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone,2012
Red,All Too Well,But you keep my old scarf from that very first week,2012
Red,All Too Well,'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me,2012
Red,All Too Well,"You can't get rid of it, 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah",2012
Red,All Too Well,Because there we are again when I loved you so,2012
Red,All Too Well,Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known,2012
Red,All Too Well,"It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well",2012
Red,All Too Well,"Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all",2012
Red,All Too Well,"Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all",2012
Red,All Too Well,"It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well",2012

Red,22,"This place is too crowded, too many cool kids, uh uh, uh uh",2012
Red,22,"(Who's Taylor Swift, anyway? Ew)",2012
Red,22,It seems like one of those nights,2012
Red,22,We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming,2012
Red,22,Instead of sleeping,2012
Red,22,Yeah,2012
Red,22,"We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way",2012
Red,22,"It's miserable and magical, oh yeah",2012
